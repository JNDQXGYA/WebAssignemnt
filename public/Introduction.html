            I am a student at the University of Aberdeen and the South China Normal University.
            My major is Computer Science. I am currently in my second year of study.<br>
            I am interested in web application development and the teacher of this course is helpful and friendly.<br>
            Although my major is not AI, I am interested in AI and hope to make a artificial intelligence that like a real person who can grow up on its own in one day.<br><br>
